# UFO-Sightings
### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, a table was appended to web page as well as new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* A date format was used in HTML document as well as event listener through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, JavaScript code was written for the user to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
